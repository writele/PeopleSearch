This is a search application utilizing an API built on .Net Core and Angular on the front-end.

The application is currently connected to a test database. It can be run immediately from Visual Studio after the code is cloned to your computer.

To replace the current database with your own, edit the connection string in appsettings.json. 
Then run "Update-Database" via the package manager console to create the database tables and seed them with data.
